          My research in software engineering has been recognized with multiple awards and achievements. In 2022, my
          paper on Python annotations obtained the important <b>ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award</b>. Additionally, I
          was the second winner at the <b>ACM Student Research Competition</b> and won the first phase of the <b>Gnome Challenge</b>
          2020. From 2016 to 2018, I received a generous <b>scholarship</b> to study computer engineering. Furthermore, I have
          published papers in <b>international</b> peer-reviewed conferences and journals. Currently, I serve as a <b>reviewer for ACM
          TOSEM</b>, which is widely recognized as one of the most prestigious journals in software engineering.

            <h2>ESEC/FSE 2022<br><span>ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award</span></h2>
            <p>We extract 1.4 million type annotation changes
              from 9,655 Python repositories. Our results show that type annotations are clearly gaining traction, 
              yet the large majority of code elements that
              could be annotated currently remains unannotated. We see a huge
              potential for techniques that automate the process of adding types
              into an existing code base, such as neural type prediction models. Finally, many developers seem to not regularly
              check their code for statically detectable type errors, or if they do,
              commit the code despite such errors.</p></a>

            <p>We present a scalable and precise search engine for code
              changes. Given a query, the approach retrieves within seconds relevant examples from million code changes. Our query
              language extends the underlying programming language, providing an intuitive
              way of formulating queries to search for code changes. DiffSearch encodes both queries
              and code changes into a common feature space, enabling
              efficient retrieval of candidate search results. DiffSearch guarantees that every returned
              search result fits the query.</p></a>

            <h2>ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 2022</h2>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of 30 years of research on code search. Given the
              huge amounts of existing code, searching for specific code examples is a common activity during
              software development. We discuss what
              kinds of queries code search engines support, and give an overview of the main components used
              to retrieve suitable code examples. In particular, the article discusses techniques to pre-process and
              expand queries, approaches toward indexing and retrieving code, and ways of pruning and ranking
              search results.</p></a>
